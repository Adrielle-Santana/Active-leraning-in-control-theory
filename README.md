# Description of the files

- [SecondOrderSystem.pdf](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/SecondOrderSystem.pdf): Second  order  system  built  using   amplifier   circuits  used as one partial challenge. The circuit was implemented in the online free application [Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) and you can open the circuit of this second order system by importing the [SecondOrderSystem.txt](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/SecondOrderSystem.txt) file in the application. Also available in the link: https://tinyurl.com/y5yqhgur

[circuitChallenge1.pdf](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/circuitChallenge1.pdf): Scheme of the circuit built as the plant of one of final challenges. Figure 3 in the paper.
