# Active-leraning-in-control-theory
This repository contains the data that support the study presented in the paper "Active Learning Strategy Applied to Control Theory Teaching" developed by Elias J. R. Freitas, Leonardo S. Prado, Marcos V. F. Silva, Vin√≠cius A. Alvarenga and Adrielle C. Santana.

# Description of the files

- [SecondOrderSystem.pdf](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/SecondOrderSystem.pdf): Second  order  system  built  using   amplifier   circuits  used as one partial challenge. The circuit was implemented in the online free application [Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) and you can open the circuit of this second order system by importing the [SecondOrderSystem.txt](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/SecondOrderSystem.txt) file in the application. Also available in the link: https://tinyurl.com/y5yqhgur

- [circuitChallenge1.pdf](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/circuitChallenge1.pdf): Scheme of the circuit built as the plant of one of final challenges. Figure 3 in the paper.

- [PIDparallel.pdf](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/PIDparallel.pdf): Complete system with plant and PID parallel controller. The circuit was implemented in the online free application [Circuit Simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html) and you can open the circuit of this second order system by importing the [PIDparallel.txt](https://github.com/Adrielle-Santana/Active-leraning-in-control-theory/blob/main/PIDparallel.txt) file in the application.
